# üßµ Real-Time Cloth Simulation using XPBD and B-spline Surface

![Simulation Screenshot](./img.png)

## üí° Overview

This project implements a **real-time cloth simulation** using **XPBD (eXtended Position-Based Dynamics)** and enhances its visual quality through **B-spline surface reconstruction**. It was developed as a course project for **CPSC 589: Modeling for Computer Graphics** at the University of Calgary.

By simulating a **low-resolution mesh** and rendering a **high-resolution B-spline surface**, this project achieves **visually pleasing results** with **low computational cost**.
